## brief description:
The initial code I supplied was merely a file, therefore I made sure to send the correct papers based on the feedback. I also make certain that the code is nice enough to be legible and comprehensible. I added a few comments to assist describe what each code does, so that the stages as the code progressed would be clearer. To avoid confusion, my variables and classes have descriptive names that relate to the situation. The code is simple to comprehend because it adheres to specific principles that encourage clarity and simplicity. To indicate the purpose and intention of variables, functions, and classes, one fundamental notion is to use descriptive naming patterns. All of these elements lead to code that is easier to comprehend and maintain over time.
